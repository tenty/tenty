# Hi there! I'm Tenty 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **hobby coder** who loves exploring the world through code. GitHub is my place to learn, experiment, and contribute to projects I find interesting so most of my projects are private, and I'm starting to open up about which projects I want to share with the world.

### 🚀 My Current Tech Stack

My primary passion is **Python**, which I use for everything from small scripts to personal projects.

While Python is my go-to, I also have a working knowledge of:
* **Perl**
* **PHP**
